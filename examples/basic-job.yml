--- This is a basic job to demonstrate how runno jobs are structured
tasks:
  --- The list of tasks in this job
  -
    --- A generic task 
    id: task-one
    cmd: >
      echo This is task-one reporting >> jobs.log
    dependencies: []
  
  -
    --- A task that simulates processing with sleep
    id: another-task
    cmd: >
      sleep 5; echo I just slept a bit >> jobs.log
    dependencies: []
  
  -
    --- This task needs the previous two to complete before it can start
    id: dependant-task
    cmd: >
      echo I cant run until my dependencies finish >> jobs.log
    dependencies:
      - task-one
      - another-task
  
  -
    --- This task calls another job
    id: recursive-task-2
    cmd: >
      node runno -j ./examples/arg-job.yml
    dependencies:
      - dependant-task
